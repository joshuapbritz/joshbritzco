# Josh Britz Co.

This is the repo for my personal website https://joshbritz.co.

It is built with parcel bundler and vanilla JavaScript (with superpowers thanks to TypeScrtipt). I'm using Workbox for service worker so that the site can function offline and I'm using **dev.to**'s api to power my blog content.

> If you want to check out tests and experiments that I'm doing with my site, check out https://beta.joshbritz.co

## Running the Project

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies with: `yarn install`
- Start the dev server: `yarn start`
