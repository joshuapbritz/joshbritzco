          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a self taught developer from Johannesburg, South Africa. I
            started my development journey at the age of thirteen and it has
            been all love since then.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have now been working for
            <script>
              const today = new Date();
              const started = new Date(2017, 0, 26);

              const months = today.getMonth() - started.getMonth();
              const years = today.getFullYear() - started.getFullYear();

              document.currentScript.outerHTML = `${years} years and ${months} month${
                months === 1 ? '' : 's'
              }`;
            </script>
            as of this month. My passion is frontend development and my current
            role is UX Engineer. Under this title I work to improve relations
            between designers and developers, create and maitain component
            librararies and style guides, as well as researching new tech and
            frameworks. I also create tools for the other developers I work with
            to make their workflows easier.
