    A common frustration I come across when working with Angular (or any other
    framework for that matter), is running functions based on key bindings. The
    typical method of doing this is unreadable and messy. For example, if you
    wanted to run a function when a user hit <strong>CTRL+ALT+D</strong> your
    code would look something like this.

    True, it could be worse. Never the less, doing this can become very messy
    very quickly. It is also difficult to quickly find and fix problems because
    you have to know exactly which key code is which to know what key command is
    being listened for. In a recent project I was working on, I decided to
    remedy the issue by abstracting the proccess into an Angular service and now
    I'm going to show you how to do it.

  <h2>Creating a project</h2>
  <p>
    Because we are making an Angular service, you will need to have an angular
    project to work in. You can use an exsisting one, or you can create a new
    blank project to play around with.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should now have a fresh project to work in.

  <h2>Setting things Up</h2>
  <p>
    First of all we need to create a service that will do all our work.
  </p>
  <app-terminal-snippet>{{ snippets.snippet3 }}</app-terminal-snippet>
  <p>
    Your newly made service should look something like this.
  </p>
  <app-code-snippet
    [snippet]="snippets.snippet4"
    lang="javascript"
    src="key-bind.service.ts"
  ></app-code-snippet>
  <p>
    In the same folder as your service, create two new files: one called
    <strong>modifiers.ts</strong> and one called
    <strong>keycodes.ts</strong> and copy the following code into them. You can
    move these later, but for now it is easier to keep them in the same folder
    as your service.
  </p>
  <app-code-snippet
    [snippet]="snippets.snippet5"
    lang="javascript"
    src="keycodes.ts"
  ></app-code-snippet>

  <app-code-snippet
    [snippet]="snippets.snippet6"
    lang="javascript"
    src="modifiers.ts"
  ></app-code-snippet>

  <p>
    These files contain helpers we will use to make our service work properly.
    For example <strong>keycodes.ts</strong> has a list of all the key codes,
    mapped to readable names, and <strong>modifiers.ts</strong> has a helper
    function to check if one or more modifier keys are present in and event.
  </p>

  <p>
    Theoretically, they already make your life easier. You could use them as
    below.
  </p>

  <app-code-snippet
    [snippet]="snippets.snippet7"
    lang="javascript"
  ></app-code-snippet>

  <p>
    This code is much cleaner, but we can do better than that. What we want is a
    declarative way of listening to key events.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the key bind service you will create a new method called
    <strong>match()</strong>. We will have parameters so that you can specify
    the keys and modifiers you want to listen for, an optional EventTarget so
    that you can specify where to listen for the events, and return an
    Observable that fires when the binding is matched.
