Emails suck, and sometimes you just want to say what you really mean. Here is a list of some of my favourite email openers that you definitely shouldn't use.

## Untethered
```txt
Dear [name],

I hope this email finds you before I do...
```

## Desperate?
```txt
Dear [name],

I hope this email finds, as the search and rescue team is otherwise out of ideas...
```
