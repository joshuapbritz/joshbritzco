One of the more polarizing topics amongst frontend developers today is the question of which JavaScript framework is better. Some say its React because of its simple structure, its features like hooks or jsx, and its general popularity. Others argue that it is Angular because of its general versatility, its strongly opinionated file structure, and its richness of features. Or they may say its Vue or Svelte or Ember or Preact or any other number of JS frameworks (all with awesome features that the others don't have). So, which one is the best then? How can we possibly tell? Do we check the frameworks popularity amongst developers or how many projects use that framework in the real world? Here's the truth - we often group these frameworks together because they all label themselves as being similar. A lot of the time, we are trying to decide between a scalpel and a chef's knife when we are trying to cut through a dense jungle.

Each and every one of the JS frameworks that are out there today are popular for a reason, and each are good at doing certain things. Now I'm not saying that what one framework can do, the others cannot, but that each framework has things that they doing exceptionally well and things that they could do better.
