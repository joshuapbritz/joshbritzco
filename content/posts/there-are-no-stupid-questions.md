There are many developers today that are one-hundred percent self-taught. For the sake of this article, it may be better to call them self-motivated. These are developers that have gone through non-traditional channels in their journey to becoming developers. In my opinion, these kinds of developers have taken a better career path than those who opted to study computer science before starting to work in the industry. Don't get me wrong here. I'm not condemning those who have chosen to study computer science, nor am I calling those who have chosen to do so stupid. I do, however, feel like there is a strong case to be made in favour of skipping that step (at least at the start of your career). 

Now, this is important to set up the point I am trying to make in this article. For the longest time, many companies valued a piece of paper stating your qualifications far more than they cared about your experience or skills as an individual. That is not to say that there were no companies that were able to look past someone not having a certificate, but there were certainly not very many of them. This has led to a mindset that has become so ingrained in our culture that we do not even interrogate it anymore. We've come to see those who have been to a college or university to study the field we work in as being far superior in that field than we are. Once again, I will state, I am not bashing on people who have chosen to enrol in Tertiary education. My point here is that not every field that can be studied should be studied or needs to be studied. I have a lot more to say on this issue and I think I may write another article going into more detail on the subject, but for now, I just want to get you thinking about it in light of this article's subject matter.

##### What is imposter syndrome?
I think that every one of us probably feels the effect of imposter syndrome. Wikipedia (not the best source of information, but bear with me here) defines Imposter Syndrome as "psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments or talents and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a 'fraud'". Now if there were just a small subset of people who feel the effects of imposter syndrome, it may be something that we have to interrogate in a different light. But I'm willing to bet that almost any developer that you asked would if they are being honest, have experienced the effects of imposter syndrome before. Don't believe me? We let me ask you some questions. Have you ever felt stupid when asking a colleague or even Google a question about some problem you're having because you are worried that the answer to the question is something that you should already know? Have you ever started to write an article, but stopped because you thought "Surely I'm the only one who would find this useful. Everyone else already knows this don't they"? Have you ever looked at your code and mused to yourself "is this how a real developer would write this code"? 

Maybe I'm the only one who has asked these questions, but I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm not.
