> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. - _Albert Einstein_

The concept of learning by teaching is not a new thing in the world. A very common example of this idea in use is in something called the Feynman Technique. This technique works like this:

1. Find a concept or idea you want to learn
2. Pretend that you are going to teach that to someone with no experience or related experience with that concept.
3. Identify gaps in your explanation. Revise and adapt what you have until you can explain the idea or concept simply and easily.
4. Revise, Review, and Simplify your explanation.

This method is one of the most useful ways to take in new information because it forces you to step outside of your own head and think about aspects of an idea that sometimes you would never consider. It is often very easy to "get by" in doing something by imitating what you have seen other people do. This is a common occurrence among coders in my experience. There have been many times when I have gone through code with other people and asked "what does this thing do?" or "how does that work?" and the response is "I dunno, but it doesn't work without it". Now we have all been there and have all done that, but that does leave you open to a plethora of bugs that can be extremely hard to solve or even find. As developers, one of the best ways we can improve ourselves is to gain a deeper understanding of the code we are writing, and the best way to do that is to teach others the concepts you are struggling with.

Now it is only natural to shy away from this idea. It is far easier to stick to what we are good at, especially when it comes to teaching. After all, why would people want to learn from someone who is almost as new to a concept as they are? Here's the thing: Sometimes people need teachers that are closer to their level to help them truly understand what's going on. I'm not saying this to discredit being taught by experts, but to say that you don't have to be an expert to teach.

In fact, the quickest way you become an expert is through teaching. You see, thinking about teaching a topic puts you into a very specific mindset. You stop (or at least should stop) asking **how** or **if** something works, and start asking **why** something works. The question of why a thing works is possible the most essential way of getting to understand it fully. For example, knowing **if** a washing machine works does not give me much ability to do anything. I have no way of making it do what I want it to, and if something breaks or goes wrong I have no ability to do anything about the problem because my knowledge is only surface level. If I know **how** that washing machine, I have the ability to get it to do the things I want it to do. I can start a wash cycle or make it rinse out my clothing. However, I'm still at a loss if something on it breaks. Finally, if I know **why** my washing machine works, that is, if I know what goes into it washing my clothes and rinsing them out then when something goes wrong, I am more capable of getting to the bottom of the issue. I can figure out what is not working because I know why it should be work and what it is supposed to do. 

Now, this principle of teaching to learn helps you achieve what I am going to call the **why knowledge** of a topic. You see, when you are learning by yourself you can very easily learn the rules and limits of a topic. You can learn what you can do and what you can't. This is the **if** stage of learning. The early stages of learning almost always start with some form of this. You get familiar with how things should look under the umbrella of a concept, and can even see when something violates one of the rules of the concept. After this, you begin to grow familiar with the concept. You start to see patterns between the rules that determine how each rule can be used in context. You will become enabled to use those rules for yourself and to build upon them. This is the **how** stage of learning. Many developers have an if and how knowledge of the code they write. However, the mark of a good developer is one who has the **why knowledge**. This is gain be interrogating the rules and relationships that you learned in the **if** and **how** stages and figuring out what their purpose is. It is at this point when you deepen your knowledge of the concept you are learning by getting to its core and understanding what lies beneath its abstracted simplicity. This can happen organically over time, but often it requires a deal of effort and study from the one who is trying to learn. When you think about teaching a concept, you are forced to think about why it works because we naturally want to help the people we are teaching to the best of our abilities. Thus, we put a great deal of effort getting familiar that concept to a point where we escalate our depth of knowledge and very quickly get to the bottom of why that thing works.

When you break into the core of the concept by trying to predict what questions people will have about a topic and what they might not understand about it, you force your brain to think in a bigger space than just your own understanding and skill level. You force yourself to ask the questions that they are going to ask and allow yourself to be confused by the things they will be confused by.
