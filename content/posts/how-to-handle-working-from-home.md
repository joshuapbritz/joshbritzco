At this point in time, you really have to have been living under a rock to not be aware of the huge effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the work environment. Practically every company that can has moved to a remote working style, and almost all of them have found themselves better off for it. However, working from home is a complete paradigm shift for anyone who hasn't done so before. It requires a complete shift in your mindset to no longer have the accountability or social aspects of an office, especially if you are an extrovert. Yet, working from home offers a huge amount of benefits to the person who knows how to make proper use of the situation. Here are some of my favorite ways of taking full advantage of working from home - maximizing your productivity and your work-life balance. These tricks may not be useful to everyone, but I have found them to be enormously beneficial in keeping my head above water during this time. 

#### 1. Start the work day off early
Off the bat, I am really not a morning person. I tend towards tha habits of a night owl, finding that I am more active during the evening. It may seem counter productive, but I have found that getting started with my work day earlier has lead to me having more time in the afternoon/evening for personal errands and tasks. It isn't even as difficult as you might think. I have found that I can wake up later than I would wake up to go into the office, and still I end up starting to work earlier than if I was going to the office. The trick is preparation. Make sure that getting started in the morning takes the least amount of effort. You can prepare your breakfast the evening before so that that takes less time out of your morning. Ensure that everything you need to get started for the day is ready before you wake up. It has been my experience that streamlining this whole process has lead to me having far more fulfilling and productive days.

#### 2. Cook your own lunch, or at least have it fresh
One of the best things about working from home has been the fact that I can make my own lunches from scratch. Not only is this more cost effective, it means that I eat a lot more healthy food. I cannot recommend this enough. I personally enjoy cooking a lot, so this is something that has been a delightful benefit to working from home but, understandably enough, not everyone enjoys or is good at cooking. Nothing helps your day quite like having a wholesome homemade meal.
