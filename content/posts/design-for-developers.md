Many developers have this paralyszing fear of designs. Whether it be creating the designs themselves or just having to implement them. I hear all too many developers demo things they have built to me with the common caveat "It's functional, but I'm not a designer". Then there is "The Great War", the age old emnity between the designers and the developers in a company. The two parties are seen as oposing sides in a battle in which they end up building a website. Developers grumble under their breath and call curses upon the designers as they have to fix layout and spacing issues that are "trivial". Designers get frustrated and annoyed because their picture perfect designs that they made on their overpriced retina iMacs don't look right. 

Now, I am not a designer. I do work closely with designers in my day to day job, but I am first and foremost a developer. As part of my job, I have the responsibilty of promoting the use of design and design systems throughout the company where I work. Howver, in doing this, I have found that many developers do not adequately understand the purpose of design. If you were to ask a developer what they thought design is, you would like get some variation of the following answer.

> Design is the process of making user interface look pretty.

But this is not what design is at all. Yes, design does involve making things look nice, but that is not its primary purpose. At its core, design is about creating pleasant and functional experiences for the people who use an interface. It isn't about the looks necessarily. In fact, most designers only get to the looks of a design in its final stages. The majority of time is (or should be) spent on figureing out how people are going to be using a product, and how that process can be made easier. So whay is this important? Well, if you understand this, you can start to understand design and you can equip yourself to be a better developer overall.
