My entry into frameworks on the web was Angular 2+. Before I learnt that, I had been using either jQuery or straight up vanilla JS for the applications that I created. And let me tell you, Angular was a welcome change. Don't get me wrong, I loved (and still love) building pages with plain ol' JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but Angular was a whole new world for me. TypeScript, ViewModels, Services, Dependency Injection, and more. Things flowed and made sense. Projects were easy to organise, easy to debug, and easy to build. It was bliss, and I very quickly became highly comfortable with the framework. I have even built a number of high traffic websites for major companies using the framework, and I have had no regrets. 

So what does this have to do with Hugo? Well, I have a tendency of "sticking to my guns" when it comes to the tools and proccess I use in coding. I love Angular, and for a while, that was the only thing I built applications or websites with. But things were getting stale for me. I hadn't gotten to a point where I was feeling a little bored of it. But it was hard to move I way from it. I had been one of the promoters of the framework within the company where I work and so I felt like it would be somewhat hypocritical to say let's try something else. And then the worry was "what would we even try?".
